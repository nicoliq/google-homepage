For this project (from The Odin Project's "Foundations" curriculum segment), I am demonstrating my HTML and CSS skills by deconstructing and rebuilding the Google homepage. In doing so, I will be required to show that I can also:
Use two ways to move a div around on the page
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
Identify the background color of an existing webpage
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
Center an element horizontally
Identify three ways I can include my CSS styles in a page
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
