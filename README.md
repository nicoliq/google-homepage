For this project (from The Odin Project's "Foundations" curriculum segment), I am demonstrating my HTML and CSS skills by deconstructing and rebuilding the Google homepage. In doing so, I will be required to show that I can also:
<br>
Use two ways to move a div around on the page
<br>
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
<br>
Identify the background color of an existing webpage
<br>
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
<br>
Center an element horizontally
<br>
Identify three ways I can include my CSS styles in a page
<br>
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
<br>
Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
